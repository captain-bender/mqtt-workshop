# MQTT Workshop

This setup launch both the MQTT broker and a Python service that continuously publishes simulated sensor data of fictional smart building.

Workshop Outline (with Paho-MQTT)
Students will write their own Python scripts on their local machine (not inside a container) to interact with the Dockerized broker. They just need to have Python and paho-mqtt installed locally (using venv is advisable).
